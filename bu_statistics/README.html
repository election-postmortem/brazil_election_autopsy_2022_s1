<h2>BU Statistics</h2>
<p>This project processes the <code>bus-%UF.comp</code> files (or a directory of ".bu.json.gz" files) and generates
multiple statistics of the BU data.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>BU</code> stands for "Boletin de Urna" (Ballot Box).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See the <code>../tse_public_data/</code> directory to generate the <code>bu-files/</code> directory
and the <code>.bu.json.gz</code> files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See the <code>bu_compressor.dart</code> tool to generate the compressed <code>bus-%UF.comp</code> files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dart SDK</h2>
<p>To download and install the Dart SDK see: <a href="https://dart.dev/get-dart">https://dart.dev/get-dart</a></p>
<ul>
<li>You need at least Dart <code>2.17.0</code> to run this project.</li>
</ul>
<p>After install the Dart SDK you need to get the project dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cd path/to/bu_statistics

dart pub get
</code></pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To generate statistics of a state in Brazil you need 2 parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>bu-files</code> directory:
<ul>
<li>With ".bu.json.gz" files in the structure:
<ul>
<li><code>bu-files/$uf/$cityCode/$uf-$$cityCode-$zoneCode-$sectionCode.bu.json.gz</code></li>
<li>OR: <code>bu-files/$uf/any/path/any-file-name.bu.json.gz</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OR a compressed BUs files: <code>bu-files/bus-$UF.comp</code></li>
<li>The output directory of the generated statistics (CSV files).</li>
</ul>
<p>Generating the statistics for a state in Brazil:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cd ./bu_statistics/

dart bin/bu_statistics.dart ../tse_public_data/bu-files/sp /tmp/bu-statistics-output
</code></pre>
<p>Using the compressed BUs file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">dart bin/bu_statistics.dart ../tse_public_data/bu-files/bus-sp.comp /tmp/bu-statistics-output
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>UF stands for a state in Brazil.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decimal delimiter</h2>
<p>To change the decimal delimiter of the CSV files pass the parameter <code>commadecimal</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">dart bin/bu_statistics.dart ../tse_public_data/bu-files/sp /tmp/bu-statistics-output commadecimal
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>NOTES:
<ul>
<li>In US the decimal delimiter is <code>.</code> (point) and in Brazil the decimal delimiter is <code>,</code> (comma).</li>
<li>The default decimal delimiter in Dart for <code>double</code> values is <code>.</code>.</li>
<li>Some software in Brazil need the <code>,</code> (comma) delimiter to work correctly (like <code>MS Excel</code> and <code>Numbers - Apple</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>BU Metrics</h2>
<p>The metrics will analyse the BU files using a BU variable to order them
and separate them in blocks. Then it will generate the voting statistics
for each block (non-cumulative from previous blocks), to see the voting
evolution based on some metric.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>closeDate</code>:
<ul>
<li>BUs ordered by <code>close</code> date.
<ul>
<li>The date of the LAST vote int the Voting Machine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Default block time window: 30s</li>
<li>Generates the voting statistics of BUs blocks for each 30s, ordered by <code>closeDate</code>.</li>
<li>Checks if the <code>closeDate</code> (last vote) of a Voting Machine influences the voting ratio for a candidate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>generationDate</code>:
<ul>
<li>BUs ordered by <code>generation</code> date.
<ul>
<li>The date that the original BU file was generated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Default block time window: 30s</li>
<li>Generates the voting statistics of BUs blocks for each 30s, ordered by <code>generationDate</code>.</li>
<li>Checks if the <code>generationDate</code> of a Voting Machine influences the voting ratio for a candidate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>emissionDate</code>:
<ul>
<li>BUs ordered by <code>emission</code> date.
<ul>
<li>The date that the original BU file was emitted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Default block time window: 30s</li>
<li>Generates the voting statistics of BUs blocks for each 30s, ordered by <code>emissionDate</code>.</li>
<li>Checks if the <code>emissionDate</code> of a Voting Machine influences the voting ratio for a candidate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>loadDate</code>:
<ul>
<li>BUs ordered by <code>load</code> date.
<ul>
<li>The date that the Voting Machine system was loaded/installed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Default block time window: 30s</li>
<li>Generates the voting statistics of BUs blocks for each 30s, ordered by <code>loadDate</code>.</li>
<li>Checks if the loaded/installed system at some date influences the voting ratio for a candidate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>votersReleasedByCodeRatio</code>:
<ul>
<li>BUs ordered by <code>votersReleasedByCodeRatio</code>.
<ul>
<li>The ratio of votes released by code (without biometric input: finger scan).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Default block window: 1% (0.01)</li>
<li>Generates the voting statistics of BUs blocks for each 1%, ordered by <code>votersReleasedByCodeRatio</code>.</li>
<li>Checks if Voting Machines with more votes without biometric input have some anomaly/tendency for a candidate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>onlyPresidentVotesRatio</code>:
<ul>
<li>BUs ordered by <code>onlyPresidentOfficeVotesRatio</code>.
<ul>
<li>The ratio of votes only for president (without vote for governor) in the same election day.</li>
<li>It can have a ratio &gt; then 1.0, since it's possible to have votes for governor and not for president too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Default block window: 1% (0.01)</li>
<li>Generates the voting statistics of BUs blocks for each 1%, ordered by <code>onlyPresidentOfficeVotesRatio</code>.</li>
<li>Checks if Voting Machines with more votes only for president have some anomaly/tendency for a candidate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>presidentAbstentionRatio</code>:
<ul>
<li>BUs ordered by <code>presidentOfficeAbstentionRatio</code>.
<ul>
<li>The ratio of abstentions for president in the same election day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Default block window: 1% (0.01)</li>
<li>Generates the voting statistics of BUs blocks for each 1%, ordered by <code>presidentOfficeAbstentionRatio</code>.</li>
<li>Checks if Voting Machines with more abstentions for president have some anomaly/tendency for a candidate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the metrics above should NOT have ANY influence over candidates voting ratio.</li>
<li>Voting ratio statistics are generated for the 2 top winners.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Generated CSV</h2>
<p>The output directory will be used to generate the statistics in the CSV format.</p>
<p>Here's an example of generated statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metric: <code>closeDate</code></li>
<li>UF: <code>sp</code></li>
<li>Parameter: <code>commadecimal</code> (using <code>,</code> as decimal separator)</li>
<li>CSV File: <code>bu-statistics--closeDate--sp.csv</code></li>
</ul>
